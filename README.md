#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to analyize and compare a cancer drug study done on 250 mice over the course of 45 days. Visualizations show the changes over time for each treatment. 

### Methods Used
* visual data analysis
* statistical analysis
* linear analysis

### Technologies
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Matplotlib
* NumPy
* Pandas 

## Project Description
This project analyzed the treatment data to compare the level of treatment response among three drug treatments and a placebo. Graphs were created to visualize the data results. Visual analysis allows easy reading of trending data such as the effect of drug treatments on metastatic spread, survival rate of mice during treatment and tumor changes at the end of treatment. 

### Observations:
    1. The placebo and drugs Infabinol and Ketapril resulted in increasing tumor growth over time. Only drug Capomulin shows effectively decreasing the volume (size) of the tumor.
